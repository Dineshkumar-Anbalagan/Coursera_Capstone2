Introduction:
   One of the major problems we are facing right now is road accidents, especially car acidents. So, this project is mainly to analyse the UK's car
accident severity based on the UK's previous car accident reports to find out the major reasons that lead to these accidents. Ok now let's get into 
the content.
DATASET:
   The source which I am going to use here to analyse to find out the major reasons for car accidents is the datset provided by the Government of United Kingdom 
which contains the entire car accident reports between 2005-2015 occured in UK(United Kingdom).
These datasets contains:
                         Location - The lat, long at which the accident occured.
                         Casualities - No of casualities.
                         Vehicle Type - The type of vehicle at which the acciednt occured.
                         Casuality class, age, sex etcetra.
                         Number of Vehicles - Total no. of vehicle involved in the accident.
